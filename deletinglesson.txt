  Far far away, behind the wild mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

  A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
sentences fly into your mouth.

  Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
continued her way.

  On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where
it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that
was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text
should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

  But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn't take long until
a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn't been rewritten, then they are still using
her.
